# Accessibility statement for the Learning and Education Network

This accessibility statement applies to content developed by the Learning and Education Network, part of NHS Elect, which produces and curates educational content focused on national surge programmes.

It does not cover content curated from third party sources, as we have limited ability to update or resolve issues with accessibility for this content. Please refer to the author accessibility statements for information when available.

Our resources are mostly hosted either on this site, or on [elearning for healthcare](https://www.e-lfh.org.uk). This site is run by the Learning and Education Network. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this content. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
- We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

We know some parts of our content are not fully accessible:

- the majority of content we have curated is from third party authors and as such we have limited control over their accessibility. Where possible we have prioritised selecting content which meets our accessibility standards.
- you cannot modify the line height or spacing of text
- some older PDF documents are not fully accessible to screen reader software
- some third party video streams do not have captions

## What to do if you cannot access parts of this website

If you need information on this website in a different format please contact learningnetwork@nhselect.org.uk and tell us:

- your name and email address
- the nature of your enquiry

We’ll consider your request and get back to you as soon as possible.

## Reporting accessibility problems with this website

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact learningnetwork@nhselect.org.uk.

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The Learning and Education Network is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

Content curated from third party sources has been checked to see if it meets our accessibility standards, and where possible we have favoured content which does so. However, some content is not accessible and we have limited access to improve where this is the case. For example:

- some PDFs are not accessible
- some videos do not have accurate captions available

## Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

Some video content produced by the Learning and Education Network do not have captions available.

We plan to add captions for all video content by April 2022. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of captions meets accessibility standards.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on the 24th March 2022 and last updated on the 17th August 2022.
